This project pulls real-time weather data from the tomorrow.io API. Machine learning is used to map temperature, humidity, and wind speed to six parameters of a mono synthesizer.

In order to use the API, you will need to get an API key. Go to tomorrow.io, select Products -> Weather API -> Sign up/Login. Your API key should be displayed at the top of the webpage. Do not share this with anyone.
Then, modify the .env file by replacing 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your API key from tomorrow.io. The default location is set to Montreal.
